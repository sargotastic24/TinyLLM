"Ben, you scared me!" Lily said. "Why did you hide in the dark hole?"

Lily frowned and said, "But it is not fun to hide in the dark. It is scary and cold. And you can't see anything."
Ben shrugged and said, "I don't mind the dark. I have my flashlight. And I can see you when you come close."
Lily shook her head and said, "I don't like the dark. It makes me feel alone and sad. And I can't see your face."
Ben looked at Lily and saw that she was upset. He felt sorry for scaring her. He said, "I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't mean to make you feel bad. Do you want me to explain why I like the dark?"
Lily nodded and said, "Yes, please. Explain to me why you like the dark."
Ben took Lily's hand and said, "Come, I'll show you." He led her to the hole and turned on his flashlight. He said, "Look, the dark is not so bad. It is like a secret place where you can imagine anything. You can pretend you are in a cave, or a spaceship, or a castle. You can make up stories and have fun."
Lily looked at the hole and saw that it was not so scary with the flashlight. She saw some rocks, some leaves, and some bugs. She said, "I see. The dark is like a game. You can use your flashlight to make shapes and shadows."
Ben nodded and said, "Yes, exactly. The dark is like a game. And you can play with me. We can be friends in the dark."
Lily smiled and said, "OK, Ben. I'll try to play with you in the dark. But can we also play in the light sometimes?"
Ben smiled and said, "Of course, Lily. We can play in the light too. We can play hide and seek anywhere. As long as we are together."
Lily hugged Ben and said, "Thank you, Ben. You are a good friend. You explained to me why you like the dark. And you made me feel better."
Ben hugged Lily and said, "You're welcome, Lily. You are a good friend too. You listened to me and you gave me a chance. And you made me happy."
They both laughed and said, "Let's play again!"

Can you forgive me?" Lily nodded. She said, "I forgive you, Max. Thank you for saying sorry. I love you, brother. Can we play together?" Max said, "I love you, too, sister. Yes, we can play together.

Ben and Lily were twins who liked to play in their room. They had many toys and books and a big bed with soft cushions. One day, they found a new game. They took the cushions and piled them up on the floor. Then they climbed on the bed and jumped on the cushions. They laughed and shouted as they bounced up and down.
"Look at me, I'm a mighty lion!" Ben roared, pretending to have claws and teeth.
"I'm a mighty princess!" Lily said, wearing a crown and a necklace.
They had so much fun that they did not hear their mom calling them for lunch. She came to their room and saw the mess. She was angry and told them to stop jumping and clean up.
"But mom, we're having fun!" Ben said, not wanting to stop.
"Yeah, mom, please let us play a little more!" Lily said, urging her mom to change her mind.
"No, you have to eat and then take a nap. You're making too much noise and you're ruining the cushions. They're not for jumping, they're for sleeping. Now come on, or you'll be in trouble." Mom said, grabbing their hands and pulling them away from the bed.
Ben and Lily were sad and mad. They did not want to eat or nap. They wanted to play. They thought their mom was mean and unfair. They did not say thank you or sorry. They pouted and whined all the way to the kitchen.
But when they came back to their room after their nap, they saw something terrible. The cushions were torn and ripped. The stuffing was everywhere. Their toys and books were broken and dirty. And on the wall, there was a big scratch and a note. It said: "I'm a mighty lion too. And I don't like noisy kids. Next time, be quiet and listen to your mom. Or I'll come back and eat you. Grrr!"
It was their cat, Fluffy, who had done it. He was hiding under the bed, looking smug and satisfied. He had heard them jumping and roaring and had decided to join the game. But he had played too rough and had destroyed everything.
Ben and Lily were shocked and scared. They cried and hugged each other. They wished they had listened to their mom and not jumped on the cushions. They learned their lesson the hard way. They realized that their mom was right and that they had been wrong. They said sorry to their mom and to each other. They helped her clean up the mess and promised to be good and quiet from then on. They hoped that Fluffy would not come back and eat them. They hoped that their mom would forgive them and love them still. They hoped that their cushions would be fixed and their toys and books would be replaced. They hoped that they would find a new game that was fun and safe and did not make anyone angry or sad.

Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They saw a big green apple on a tree. Lily wanted to eat it, but Ben wanted to throw it.
"Give me the apple, Lily. I want to play with it," Ben said.
"No, Ben. It is my apple. I want to eat it. It is yummy," Lily said.
They pulled the apple from each other. The apple broke in half. They both dropped the pieces.
"Oh no! We destroyed the apple!" Lily cried.
A bird flew down and picked up one piece. A squirrel ran and took the other piece.
"Look, Lily. The bird and the squirrel are happy. They like the apple," Ben said.
"Maybe they are hungry. Maybe we can share with them," Lily said.
They smiled and waved at the bird and the squirrel. They went to find more apples to share.

Lily and Ben were playing with marbles on the floor. They had many marbles of different colors and sizes. They liked to roll them and make them hit each other.
"Look, I have a big red marble. It is mighty. It can knock down all your marbles," Ben said. He rolled his red marble and hit Lily's blue marble. Lily's blue marble rolled away.
"That is not nice, Ben. You should share your marbles and play fair," Lily said. She was sad and angry.
"I don't want to share. I want to win. My red marble is the best," Ben said. He rolled his red marble again and hit Lily's green marble. Lily's green marble rolled away.
Lily had only one marble left. It was a small yellow marble. She did not think it was mighty. She thought it was weak. She wanted to cry.
But then she had an idea. She picked up her yellow marble and poked Ben's red marble with it. Ben's red marble did not roll. It cracked.
"Hey, what did you do? You broke my red marble. That is not fair," Ben said. He was shocked and sad.
"I poked it. You said it was mighty, but it was not. It was fragile. You should not be mean and boastful. You should be kind and humble," Lily said. She felt sorry for Ben, but also proud of her yellow marble.
Ben looked at his broken red marble and then at Lily's yellow marble. He realized that he was wrong. He said sorry to Lily and asked her to be his friend. Lily smiled and said yes. They hugged and shared their marbles. They learned that size and color do not matter. What matters is how you treat others.

"Tom, get the eggs. Tom, get the flour. Tom, get the milk. Tom, get the sugar. Tom, get the bowl. Tom, get the spoon. Tom, get the pan. Tom, hurry up!" Lily says.
Tom is tired of Lily's orders. He does not have fun. He wants to do something else.
"Lily, I don't want to cook. I want to play with my cars. You are too bossy. You do everything yourself." Tom says.
Lily is angry. She wants to cook with Tom. She thinks cooking is fun. She does not want to play with cars. She thinks cars are boring.
"Tom, you are silly. Cooking is fun. Cars are boring. You have to help me. We are a team. Mom will be happy if we cook a cake for her." Lily says.
Tom and Lily start to argue. They raise their voices. They make a mess. They spill the eggs, the flour, the milk, and the sugar. They drop the bowl, the spoon, and the pan. They do not notice mom coming home.
Mom sees the kitchen. She sees Lily and Tom. She is not happy. She is angry.
"Lily and Tom, what are you doing? Why are you making such a noise? Why are you making such a mess? You are not cooking. You are fighting. You are not a team. You are naughty." Mom says.
Lily and Tom feel sorry. They stop arguing. They apologize to mom. They help mom clean the kitchen. They hug mom. They say they love her.
Mom forgives Lily and Tom. She hugs them back. She says she loves them too. She says they can cook a cake together another day. She says they have to be nice to each other. She says they have to share and take turns. She says they have to have fun.

Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a big hill with a lot of trees. They wanted to discover what was on the other side.
"Let's go, Lily!" Ben said. "Maybe we can find a treasure or a secret cave!"
"OK, Ben!" Lily said. "But be careful. It looks dark and spooky over there."
They ran up the hill, holding hands. They heard a loud noise. It was the wind. It was blowing hard and making the trees shake and the leaves fly.
"Wow, look at the wind, Lily!" Ben said. "It's so strong and fast!"
Lily felt scared. She did not like the wind. It made her cold and it made her hair go in her eyes. She wanted to go back to the park.
"Ben, I don't like the wind," Lily said. "Can we go back, please?"
Ben looked at Lily. He saw that she was scared. He wanted to make her feel better.
"OK, Lily," Ben said. "We can go back. But first, let's do something fun. Let's make a kite!"
Ben found a stick and a plastic bag. He tied the bag to the stick with a string. He gave it to Lily.
"Here, Lily," Ben said. "This is a kite. You can hold it and let the wind lift it up. It will fly like a bird!"
Lily took the kite. She felt curious. She wanted to try it.
"Thank you, Ben," Lily said. "How do I make it fly?"
Ben showed her how to hold the string and run with the kite. They ran down the hill, laughing and shouting. The kite flew high in the sky, dancing with the wind.
Lily felt happy. She liked the kite. She liked the wind. She was not scared anymore.
She hugged Ben and said, "You are the best, Ben. You made me discover something new and fun. I love you."
Ben hugged her back and said, "I love you too, Lily. You are the best, too. You made me discover something new and sweet."

Tom likes to polish his dad's razor. He thinks it is a shiny toy that makes his dad's face smooth. He waits for his dad to go to work, then he sneaks into the bathroom and takes the razor from the drawer. He rubs it with a cloth until it sparkles.
One day, Tom sees a unique thing on the wall. It is a big mirror that shows him and the razor. He wonders what will happen if he touches the razor to his face. He thinks it will make him look like his dad. He lifts the razor and moves it closer to his cheek.
But the razor is not a toy. It is sharp and hurts Tom. He feels a sting and sees red on his face and on the mirror. He drops the razor and starts to cry. He runs to his mom and shows her his boo-boo. She is scared and angry. She hugs him and puts a band-aid on his cut. She tells him to never touch the razor again. She says it is dangerous and not for kids.
Tom is sorry and sad. He does not want to polish the razor anymore. He says he is sorry to his mom and his dad. He learns his lesson and plays with his safe toys instead. He likes his cars and his blocks and his teddy bear. He does not need the razor to look like his dad. He loves his dad and his dad loves him, even with a band-aid on his face.

"Let's eat some prunes!" Tim said.
"OK!" Sue said.
They opened the bag and took out some prunes. They put them in their mouths and chewed. But the prunes were not yummy and sweet. They were dry and sour and bitter. They made their faces twist and their tongues hurt.
"Yuck!" Tim said. "These prunes are stupid!"
"Yuck!" Sue said. "They are bad!"

One day, Anna went to the park with her daddy. She saw a big slide and wanted to try it. She signed to her daddy, "Can I go on the slide, please?" Her daddy smiled and nodded. He signed, "Yes, you can. Be careful and have fun."
Anna ran to the slide and waited for her turn. She saw a boy in front of her. He had curly hair and a red shirt. He looked at Anna and said something. Anna did not hear him. She smiled and signed, "Hello, I am Anna. What is your name?"
The boy frowned and said something again. He pointed at his mouth and shook his head. He did not sign. He did not understand Anna. He was ignorant. He pushed Anna and said, "Go away, you are weird. You can't talk."
Anna felt hurt and scared. She did not like the boy. She did not want to play with him. She ran back to her daddy and hugged him. She signed, "Daddy, the boy was mean to me. He did not sign. He did not like me."
Her daddy hugged her back and kissed her head. He signed, "I am sorry, Anna. The boy was ignorant. He did not know how to sign. He did not know how to be kind. You are not weird. You are wonderful. You can talk. You can sign. You are my smart and brave girl. I love you."

Lily liked to play with her toys on the big cushion in the living room. She had a doll, a bear, a car and a ball. She made them talk and move and have fun. One day, she saw a fly on the cushion. It was not moving. Lily touched it with her finger. It was dead.
Lily felt sad for the fly. She wanted to help it. She ran to the kitchen and got a cup of water. She poured some water on the fly. Maybe it was thirsty, she thought. But the fly did not wake up. It was still dead.
Lily got an idea. She ran to her room and got a blanket. She wrapped the fly in the blanket and put it on the cushion. She said, "Good night, fly. I hope you have good dreams." Then she got her doll and hugged it. She said, "Thank you, doll, for being my friend. You are not dead. You are alive and happy."
Lily's mom came into the living room and saw Lily and her doll on the cushion. She smiled and said, "What are you doing, Lily?" Lily looked up and said, "I am playing with my toys, mom. And I am saying thank you to them. They are good toys. They make me happy."
Lily's mom sat down next to Lily and said, "That's very nice of you, Lily. It's good to say thank you to the things and people that make you happy. And it's good to be kind to the things and people that are not happy. Like the fly. You tried to help the fly, didn't you?" Lily nodded and said, "Yes, mom. But the fly was dead. I could not make it alive. I was sad."
Lily's mom hugged Lily and said, "I know, Lily. Sometimes things die and we can't do anything about it. It's okay to be sad. But it's also okay to be happy. Because you have a lot of things and people that love you. Like me. And dad. And your toys. And the cushion. And the sun. And the moon. And the stars. And many more. Can you say thank you to them, too?" Lily smiled and said, "Yes, mom. Thank you, mom. Thank you, dad. Thank you, toys. Thank you, cushion. Thank you, sun. Thank you, moon. Thank you, stars. Thank you, thank you, thank you."

Lily climbed up the ladder and got ready to slide. But then she saw a boy with red hair and green eyes. He was waiting for his turn. He looked at Lily and said, "Hey, you have weird skin. What is your name?"
Lily felt sad and scared. She did not like the boy's words. She said, "My name is Lily. What is your name?"
The boy said, "My name is Max. And I have the best skin. It is red and green, like a firework. You have boring skin. It is white, like snow. I am envious of nothing."
Ben heard what Max said. He felt angry and brave. He climbed up the ladder and stood next to Lily. He said, "You are wrong, Max. Lily's skin is not boring. It is beautiful, like a flower. And my skin is not weird. It is cool, like chocolate. We have different skin, but we are both good. You are envious of everything."
Max did not know what to say. He felt ashamed and small. He ran away from the slide. Ben and Lily smiled at each other. They slid down together and hugged. They were happy and proud. Their moms saw them and clapped. They had the best skin. It was the skin of friends.

Lily and Tom were playing dress-up in their room. They had many clothes and hats and shoes to try on. They liked to pretend they were different people and animals. Lily put on a red dress and a big hat. She said, "I am a queen. You have to do what I say." Tom put on a blue shirt and a tie. He said, "I am a teacher. You have to learn what I teach."
They played for a long time, but then they heard their mom call them for dinner. They had to end their game and go downstairs. They started to take off their clothes and put them back in the closet. But Lily wanted to keep her hat. She said, "This is my hat. I want to wear it for dinner." Tom said, "No, you have to put it back. It is not yours. It is mom's hat. She will be mad if you take it."
They began to fight over the hat. They pulled and tugged and shouted. The hat fell to the floor. They both reached for it, but they knocked over a hanger. The hanger hit the lamp and the lamp fell down. It made a loud noise and broke. They both stopped and looked at the mess. They were scared and sorry.
Mom heard the noise and came upstairs. She saw the broken lamp and the clothes and the hat. She was not happy. She said, "What happened here? Why did you make such a mess? Why did you fight over the hat?" Lily and Tom hung their heads. They said, "We are sorry, mom. We were playing dress-up and we did not want to end. We both liked the hat and we did not share. We did not mean to break the lamp."
Mom sighed and said, "I understand you were having fun, but you have to be careful and respectful. The hat is mine and you have to ask me before you use it. The lamp is ours and you have to be gentle with it. The clothes are yours and you have to put them away. Now, help me clean up this mess and then we can go for dinner. And no more fighting, okay?"
Lily and Tom nodded and said, "Okay, mom. We are sorry. We will help you. We will not fight." They picked up the clothes and the hat and the hanger. They helped mom sweep the glass and fix the lamp. They hugged mom and said, "We love you, mom. You are the best." Mom smiled and said, "I love you too, Lily and Tom. You are the best too. Now, let's go and eat. I made your favorite soup." They went downstairs and ate their soup. They were calm and happy. They ended their day with a good night kiss.
